This project was my OS assignment, in which I designed and implemented a concurrent port scheduling system in POSIX-compliant C on Linux. The system handles ship docking, cargo operations, and undocking using multiple processes. Inter-process communication was managed using System V IPC mechanisms, including message queues and shared memory. Ensured real-time scheduling and coordination through robust process synchronization techniques.
